GitLab is a tool to enhance the workflow of teams and enable parts of the DevOps life cycle. It started out as a tool only for source code management, but today, GitLab can offer help ranging from managing an initial idea to building and testing source code, all the way from development to production.

You'll learn ways to use all of the features available in GitLab to enhance your business via the integration of all phases of the development process. You'll benefit from lower friction by creating one platform on-premises or in the cloud, increase collaboration, and drive competitive advantage with more efficient operations.
